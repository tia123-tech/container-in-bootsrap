        <h1>Reading</h1>
        <p>Reading teleports you in a different world, a free ticket to any place and an adventure to go with it. Reading books makes you live in a different world, watching charecters in front of you, imaging their ife and,by the end of the book, knowingthe entire life of a charecter, and to me, reading is ALWAYS better than TV!</p>

        <h1>Art</h1>
        <p>Art is not a piece of paper burt a feeling made by the strokes of a brush. It can tell a tale better than any words. Art itself can not be described by any words... </p>

        <h1>sports</h1>
        <p>Basketball, cricket and badmington are all sports i practice. To exel in sports you need to give your sweat and time, and the reward is glory and pride. People complain of having "less time" but everyone has 24hrs only, Virat kohli and Lionel messi did not get extra time, they made time. And so can you if you're truly passionate about a thing you love.  </p>
